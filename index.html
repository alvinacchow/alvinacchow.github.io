        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Hi! My name is Alvina Chow, and I am a first-year undergraduate student
            at the University of California, Irvine. I study software engineering
            with a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship as I aspire to become
            a product manager in the tech industry. I hope to envision, innovate,
            and implement products that are capable of easing our daily lives. I
            can't wait to see what the future holds!
        </p>

    <div class="why">
        <h2>Why Product Management?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I am interested in product management because it combines my two loves: 
            business and technology. I discovered my love of computer science and
            software engineering in high school as I loved creating fun programs
            for my computer science classes. I have always been an entrepreneurial 
            person, hoping to one day sell my baked goods and other food creations
            at the local farmers market. Product management offers me an opportunity
            where I can dive into my two passions of tech and business together as I drive my 
            team to create life-changing products. 
            <br>
            <br>
            People use tons of products every day without realizing it. For example,
            people wake up daily using the alarm on their Clock app but haven't stopped
            to consider the development of such a product. What fascinates me most about 
            product development is that it was a complicated process to create this software, 
            traveling through a long product cycle through a network of interdependent 
            teams. In the end, users are able to fully integrate the tech and make
            full use of my creations. I am passionate about Product Management because
            I want to partake in and pioneer ideation to eventually build software that
            truly transforms one's life. My team and I can bear the challenges
            users face in life by creating software solutions that will allow them to
            forget the minor difficulties they once had.
