# Alvina's Portfolio Website

## Introduction 
Hi there! This project is my portfolio website, which is my first project on my Github. This website just covers some basic information about me, such as my career endeavors, contact information, and resume. Coded using HTML and Javascript.


## Process
I coded this website using HTML and CSS by following several Youtube tutorials. I also used Visual Studio Code for the first time while committing through Github. I also created the visual graphics of the site, such as the logo and portrait image using Canva. 

I first coded the desktop version of the site, which went relatively well. However, I ran into some problems when trying to adapt the site for mobile devices, especially phones of different sizes. I ultimately solved this issue by learning when to use pixel versus percentage measurements. 

## Conclusion
Overall, I learned a lot by creating this website and hope to amend it in the future as my experiences expand. I also wish to learn more about Git and use it in future projects. I hope you enjoyed viewing my website!
